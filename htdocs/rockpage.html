				<h1>Rock Music</h1>
				<article>
					<p>Rock, also known as rock and roll, is a popular type of music that emerged in the 1940s. The genre combines
					various elements and influences from earlier types of music with a little twist of added electric instruments, 
					especially with the sound rock is often associated with which is the rock or electric guitar. This was considered 
					to be the “pop” music of youth before EDM dominated the current generation. In fact, it’s so popular that it’s more 
					of a supergenre because it’s so diverse.</p>
					
					<p>According to the Dictionary, the term Rock n’ Roll came from the metaphor “rocking and rolling,” which was first
					used by sailors to describe a ship‘s movement but became popular to mean dancing and doing the birds and the bees. 
					Then in a radio show, Alan Freed used said phrase to describe the sound of rock music, eventually reaching the common
					vocabulary. </p>
				
					<p>Rock music is commonly associated with certain instruments as mentioned before. These instruments are often the
					electric guitar, the bass, and the drums. Another key sound of rock music is the loud and often powerful vocals assisted 
					by the amplifier, which is a device that inputs small sounds and output them into much bigger sounds. Occasionally, bands 
					would use keyboards as well. Experimenting with these sounds allowed rock to expand as a much broader genre, leading to 
					many types of rock like death metal, alternative rock, etc.</p>
					
					<p>Rock music appeals to people through its passion and boldness, making its audience unable to take their eyes away from 
					performances under the genre. It can make any listener feel confident and proud of themselves, like they can take on anything
					the world throws against them. Lyrics found in rock music can feature any kind of topic and the way of rock music allows for
					easy expression of from-the-heart thoughts and emotions. Musicians would perform while dancing to the beat along with the 
					audience. It’s great this way. After all, its name is rock n’ roll.</p>
